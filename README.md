# TheCoderGuru

Let's face it, we are all working on code on a day to day basis and sometimes late at night, 
hence its best to have a theme that enables productivity during the night and helps you be productive.

I took inspiration from Dracula Theme and then tweaked the colors around to achieve this desired theme.

<br>

**This theme will be maintained and updated as I have time.**

<br>

I hope you enjoy using this theme and it helps you in some way or the other.

Cheers and happy coding
